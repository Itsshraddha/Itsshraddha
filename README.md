My interests include component-based architecture, frontend performance optimization, and crafting seamless user experiences.<br><br>ü§ù I‚Äôm open to collaborating on real-world projects, hackathons, and open-source contributions that merge innovation with usability ‚Äî especially in the area of web-based interfaces and interactive design.<br>‚ö° I enjoy turning wireframes into polished interfaces as much as solving logic problems ‚Äî and sometimes I refactor my code just to make it look cleaner, even if it works fine!<br> <br><br>
